# fancy readme here.


```

I post random stuff in Guthub that interests me or things that I have made or contributed to.
I am nowhere an expert at Github/Git... maybe soon we will be.

I wanna make ALOT of stupid things and learn from it. this is basically the place for shit I created.
Feel free to check things out, star it, fork it, make a new issue etc.
No DRAMA in my github page guys please and I guess thats it! (not a ronnie mcnutt reference I swear)
